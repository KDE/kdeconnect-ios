There are three states shown as device icon:

- **Connected** (green): paired and reachable,
- **Saved** (gray): paired but not reachable, and
- **Visible** (cyan): unpaired but reachable.

There are some actions you can do with the devices on the main window:

- **Select and right-click** to pair/unpair and interact with connected devices;
- **Drag-and-drop** file to a connected device to send; otherwise the icon will turn red if the device is not reachable.
- **Battery information** will be displayed on icons of eligible devices as an arc:
    - **Blue** is for battery consuming and having abundant remaining charge;
    - **Yellow** is for battery consuming and having &lt; 40% charge;
    - **Red** is for battery consuming and having &lt; 10% charge or reached a threshold; and
    - **Green** is for battery charging.
