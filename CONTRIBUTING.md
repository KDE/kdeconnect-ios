# Getting Involved with KDE Connect iOS

There are many aspects of contributing to and help maintaining the KDE Connect iOS project.

## Contributors

### Adding Features, Documentation, and Fixing Bugs

Checking and updating [Bugs](https://bugs.kde.org/buglist.cgi?cmdtype=runnamed&list_id=2392382&namedcmd=KDE%20Connect%20iOS)
and [Phabricator](https://phabricator.kde.org/project/board/159/) tasks (tagged `iOS`),
as well as documenting about how to use/develop KDE Connect iOS are all valuable contributions
through either [KDE's GitLab](https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-ios) or one of the Wiki's:

- [KDE Connect iOS](https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-ios/-/wikis/home)
- [Community](https://community.kde.org/KDEConnect)
- [UserBase](https://userbase.kde.org/KDEConnect)

### Performing Code Review

Testing the application to see if the app works as intended and/or
to see if the code follows best practices. Here's a checklist that might be helpful:

### Spreading the Words

Many open source beginners are looking for exciting projects to join,
and you can let them know about KDE Connect and other KDE projects.
Especially for KDE Connect iOS, the people who can help out the most (iOS developers)
are likely unfamiliar with KDE community, so going to communities
such as [Xcoders](https://xcoders.org) and [iOS Dev Happy Hour](https://www.iosdevhappyhour.com),
regional events like [try! Swift](https://www.tryswift.co)
or global conferences like [WWDC](http://developer.apple.com/wwdc),
or posting to online forums like [r/swift](https://www.reddit.com/r/swift/) on Reddit,
sharing your experiences working on KDE Connect iOS
or deliver talks about knowledge you learned by working with this project
can all be great ways to increase liveliness with this project.

## Maintainers

Once you've become a frequent contributor to the KDE Connect iOS project,
an existing maintainer can recommend you to join KDE's Apple Developer team
and access App Store Connect, which allows you to

- upload new TestFlight public beta builds and fill in the release notes,
   + ideally, this should be automated
- make a new release for everyone to download from App Store
   + the next beta build needs a new Version number and takes longer to be reviewed by App Store review team),
- see crash reports and tester feedback to prioritize high-impact and triage obscure bugs, and
- answering customer reviews from App Store
   + they'll get you reply as an email!
   + you can also search online (e.g. Reddit, YouTube) to see what people are complaining about
     and see how we can change to improve the user experience

Don't know how? Check out [Wiki](https://invent.kde.org/network/kdeconnect-ios/-/wikis/home#app-store-releases-and-beta-testing)
or documentation from Apple Developer site.
